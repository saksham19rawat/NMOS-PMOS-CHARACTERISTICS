# NMOS AND PMOS CHARACTERISTICS

## BEFORE WE PROCEED
In my circuit-design-simulation-tools repository, I covered the basics of EDA tools and how to set them up using a CMOS inverter as an example. So in this repository, weâ€™ll dive straight into the actual working of the CMOS inverter


# NMOS CHARACTERISTICS
An **NMOS transistor (n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor)** is a type of MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) that uses **n-type carriers (electrons)** as the majority charge carriers.

The **Channel** is made up of electrons and the substrate is of **P-Type** 

The flow of current is from the **Drain towards the source**
